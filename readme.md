# Food Application API Documentation

## Overview
This is a RESTful API designed for managing food-related operations, including user authentication and CRUD functionalities. The application leverages Python, Flask, Flask-RESTful, PostgreSQL, Redis, and other modern technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and security.

## Features
### 1. Authentication
 - **JWT-based Authentication**: Users authenticate via JWT tokens, ensuring secure access to protected endpoints. Tokens are issued upon successful login and are required for accessing restricted operations.
 - **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed and salted using bcrypt before storage, ensuring protection against unauthorized access.

### 2. CRUD Operations for Food Items
 - **Create**: Add new food items with detailed information, including name, description, price, and other attributes.
 - **Read**: Retrieve details of a specific food item by ID.
 - **Update**: Modify the details of an existing food item (e.g., update the price, name, or description).
 - **Delete**: Remove a food item from the system.
 - **Search**: Users can search for food items by title or keyword, with full-text search enabled.

### 3. Rate Limiting
 + **Request Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a specified period (e.g., 100 requests per hour).
 + **Redis Rate-Limiting**: Redis is used to track and manage the number of requests made by a user.

### 4. Schema Validation
 - **Enforced Data Integrity**: The system ensures that incoming data adheres to a predefined structure using Pydantic models, guaranteeing consistency and validation of inputs.

### 5. Modular Architecture
 - **Blueprints**: The application is divided into blueprints to separate concerns, making the codebase easier to manage and extend.
 - **Service Factories**: Services are organized into factory functions, improving testability and facilitating future expansions of the API.

### 6. Food Reviews
 - **User Reviews**: Users can submit reviews for food items. Reviews include ratings (1-5 stars), comments, and like/dislike status.

### 7. Caching
- **Redis Caching**: Frequently accessed food items are cached in Redis to reduce the load on the PostgreSQL database and improve response times.
- **Rate-Limiting Caching**: Redis is also used to track the number of requests made by a user, ensuring that the rate limit is respected.

## Conclusion
The **Food Application API** is a powerful and scalable solution for managing food-related operations. By leveraging modern technologies such as Flask, PostgreSQL, and Redis, the API ensures high performance, security, and scalability. With features such as JWT-based authentication, CRUD operations for food items, rate limiting, and caching, the API provides an efficient and secure platform for food management. Whether you're building a food delivery system or a restaurant management platform, this API can serve as the backbone for your application.
